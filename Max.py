a = float(input("enter a number of your choice : "))
b = float(input("enter a number of your choice : "))
c = float(input("enter a number of your choice : "))

print(max(a,b,c))
#the function max(x,y,z) is used to find the maximum number also we can use if else statements to do this question but we prefer this method to simplify this program.
